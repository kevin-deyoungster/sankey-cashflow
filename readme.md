This project takes in a CSV of transactions from [Intuit's Mint, Expenses Tracking App](https://mint.intuit.com) and summarizes cash flow into a Sankey visual, i.e.:

- exports a txt that can be used to generate a Sankey diagram at [SankeyMatic](https://sankeymatic.com/build)
- displays a sankey plot using python plotly (not as beautiful as SankeyMatic's imo)
